A Streamlit-based interactive simulator that replicates healthcare benefit rule evaluation logic. Users can input plan tier, service category, and deductible status to simulate claim outcomes like "Approved" or "Denied."

Built to reflect how Product Modelers test and validate structured logic in systems like NASCO, this tool mirrors real-world workflows involving rule-based benefit decisions and quality review (QR) processes.

Technologies: Python, Streamlit, logic-based condition handling

Use Case: Ideal for demonstrating understanding of benefit system logic and front-end driven claim evaluation workflows in healthcare tech.
